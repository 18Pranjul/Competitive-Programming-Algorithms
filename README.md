# ICPC ALGORITHM
## Mathematics_Algo 
  1) calculate_Factor :- To Calculate Factor of any number n, returns set loaded with all factors of n.
  2) gcd_Extended :- To calculate gcd with Extended Euclidean ax+by=gcd(a,b).
  3) isPrime :- To check whether a number is Prime or Not.
  4) modInverse :- To calculate modInverse of any number, (a * modInverse of a)% m = 1.
  5) nCr with Mod :- Returns (nCr)%m.
  6) nCr without Mod :- Return (nCr).
  7) power with Mod :- (n^p)%m.
  8) power without Mod :- (x^y).
  9) pre_calculate_factorial :- To pre calculate factorial and there inverse and loaded in the array.
  10) prime_factor :- Generate prime factors of any number n.
  11) seive :- Return vector with loaded prime numbers. Fill array with smallest prime factor that divides that number. Example:- for a[1] = 0, a[2] or for prime number = 1, for composite a[6] = 2.
  12) sum of GP :- Calculate sum of Geometric Progression of series (1 + r + r^2 +....+ r^(n-2) ) % m.
  13) totient :- Total numbers from 1 to N whose gcd with N is 1.

## String_Algo
  1) isVowel :- Check whether a character is vowel or not.
