# ACM-ICPC Algorithms

### Introduction to ACM-ICPC
ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (abbreviated as ACM-ICPC or ICPC) is an annual multi-tiered competitive programming competition among the universities of the world.

Alternately, we can say that the [International Collegiate Programming Contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) is an algorithmic programming contest for college students.
- Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure.
- Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise the bar on what could be done.
- Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world.

### Purpose of ACM-ICPC Algorithms
ACM-ICPC Algorithms is a collection of important algorithms and data structures used to solve questions in this worldwide olympiad. It aims to provide solutions in various languages as per [ICPC 2018 WF](https://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/programming-environment), including:
-  C
-  C++
-  Java
-  Python (2 & 3)
-  Kotlin

# COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING ALGORITHMS
## Mathematics_Algo 
  1) calculate_Factor :- To Calculate Factor of any number n, returns set loaded with all factors of n.
  2) gcd_Extended :- To calculate gcd with Extended Euclidean ax+by=gcd(a,b).
  3) isPrime :- To check whether a number is Prime or Not.
  4) modInverse :- To calculate modInverse of any number, (a * modInverse of a)% m = 1.
  5) nCr with Mod :- Returns (nCr)%m.
  6) nCr without Mod :- Return (nCr).
  7) power with Mod :- (n^p)%m.
  8) power without Mod :- (x^y).
  9) pre_calculate_factorial :- To pre calculate factorial and there inverse and loaded in the array.
  10) prime_factor :- Generate prime factors of any number n.
  11) seive :- Return vector with loaded prime numbers. Fill array with smallest prime factor that divides that number. Example:- for a[1] = 0, a[2] or for prime number = 1, for composite a[6] = 2.
  12) sum of GP :- Calculate sum of Geometric Progression of series (1 + r + r^2 +....+ r^(n-2) ) % m.
  13) totient :- Total numbers from 1 to N whose gcd with N is 1.

## String_Algo
  1) isVowel :- Check whether a character is vowel or not.
